# Spring-Image

Spring-Image is a library built to make image upload, storage and retrieval simpler in Spring web applications.
Uploads are made simpler by providing data types that can be used in Spring Documents to store MultipartFiles sent by the browser.
These files can then be stored in a data store *as-is* or stored pre-sized to make for quicker retrieval by clients later.

A demo of the library in use can be found [here](https://github.com/c1phr/spring-image-slides/tree/master/demo).
